# poke-fetch

**poke-fetch** is a small utility that combines two existing tools:

* [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch): a modern, customizable system fetch tool
* [pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts): Pokémon ASCII art

The script simply displays a Pokémon as the logo in fastfetch, vertically centered when possible.

You can provide custom options to `pokemon-colorscripts` through the script, and fastfetch remains fully configurable via its own configuration file:

```
~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc
```

## Requirements

* [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)
* [pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts)

Please refer to the linked repositories for installation instructions of these dependencies.

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the installation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/poke-fetch.git
cd poke-fetch
./install.sh
```

This installs the script to `~/.local/bin/poke-fetch`.
Make sure `~/.local/bin` is included in your `$PATH`.

---

## Usage

Run the script directly:

```bash
poke-fetch
```

To override the Pokémon command (for example, to select a specific Pokémon):

```bash
poke-fetch --poke "pokemon-colorscripts -n pikachu"
```

Fastfetch configuration (modules, system info, etc.) can be customized in:

```
~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc
```

---

## Testing the installation

To confirm installation was successful, run:

```bash
poke-fetch
```

You should see a Pokémon displayed along with your system information.

---

## Uninstallation

From the project directory, run:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This removes `~/.local/bin/poke-fetch`.
